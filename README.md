I prefer: Windows 10 OS with Visual Studio 2022 and OpenCV 4.51 with its contrib

Input: input.jpg
Output: output.jpg

Windows: To run code, go to terminal and run .\coin_counting.exe <input_image>
	For example: .\coin_counting.exe input.jpg

Linux/Unix/MacOSX: You need to build this project.

I have comment the F1-Score Calculation part in my main function, if you want to check it, uncomment it and run it.
